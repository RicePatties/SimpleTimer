# Objective
It is a simple Timer meant to be used while workout, emphasizing it's simple as to not bother your workout.

Meant to be used to time rest time between each set
Simplicity is especially Important since in workout there are lots of rests.
Even little inconvenience can fatigue user -> resulting in user not using any timer 
  -> rest time naturally increases -> less gain.
  
Each quadrant of the screen is one button.
User turns app on, it will dim the screen and each button is a timer for 45, 60 ,75sec and one cancel button.
Idea is to have a timer that does not require user to unlock the phone or reset time,
allowing user to be not bothered by it.
It can be used phone put on the ground or in the pocket.
